# Execution Summary

## Project

**AI Assistant — Internal POC** — A bilingual (Thai/English) AI-powered internal assistant that routes user requests to specialized agents (HR, Accounting, Manager, PM, Chat, Document) using an LLM orchestrator, with SSE streaming responses, file operations via MCP tools, and multi-format document export.

## Code Quality Review

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Architecture | 8/10 |
| Readability | 8/10 |
| Maintainability | 8/10 |
| Security | 7/10 |

The codebase is in good shape after 29 bug fixes across three rounds. All Critical and High severity issues have been resolved. Three Medium issues remain (two client-side sanitization edge cases and one dead function), none of which block documentation generation. The architecture is clean, security controls are comprehensive, and the SSE streaming pipeline is stable.

## Testing Results

- **Backend:** `python -m py_compile ...` passed for the modified backend files, and `test_workspace_isolation.py` passed against a live Flask server. `smoke_test_phase0.py` was updated to remove Windows-only path assumptions, but the LLM-dependent chat scenarios were not re-run in this change set.
- **Frontend:** `npm run lint` passed. `npm run build` was blocked by sandbox network restrictions because `next/font` tried to fetch Google Fonts (`Inter`, `JetBrains Mono`).
- **Frontend runtime follow-up:** the React crash caused by `MessageBubble` passing both `children` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` was fixed, and the SSE status banner now clears when a stream ends so stale "กำลังตรวจสอบ workspace..." messages do not remain visible after the answer is complete.
- **Frontend session restore:** the Next.js sidebar session list now restores the full saved conversation for the selected session into the main chat panel instead of being a non-functional placeholder.
- **Spec coverage:** This fix set specifically added coverage for session-scoped workspace/file APIs: workspace set/get, file list, preview, delete, and file isolation across two session IDs.

## Correction Loop Log

| Phase | Iterations Used | Root Cause Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 4 (Runtime) | 0 / 3 | None — no runtime errors encountered |
| Phase 5 (Testing) | 0 / 3 | None — no test failures encountered |
| Phase 5.5 (Review) | 3 / 3 | Round 1: 3 Critical + 8 High (UTF-8 truncation, workspace race, SSE cleanup, etc.) → 20 fixes. Round 2: 2 Critical + 3 High (missing routes, dead code, session workspace wiring) → 5 fixes. Round 3: 4 High (global workspace mutation, tool restriction bypass, double fail_job, UnicodeDecodeError gap) → 4 fixes. Total: 29 fixes applied. |

## Notable Technical Decisions

- **Flask over FastAPI** — Flask was chosen for its simplicity and the team's existing familiarity. The POC scope does not require async-native features; gevent provides sufficient concurrency for SSE streaming.
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL** — SQLite with WAL mode was selected for zero-configuration deployment. The graceful degradation pattern ensures the application remains functional even if the database becomes unavailable.
- **Vanilla frontend over React/Vue** — A single HTML file with inline CSS and JS eliminates build complexity, dependency management, and deployment overhead. The trade-off is a large file (~3224 lines) but no toolchain to maintain.
- **OpenRouter as AI gateway** — Using OpenRouter instead of a direct provider API allows model switching without code changes. The default model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) can be changed via a single environment variable.
- **Read-only tools for agents** — Agents receive only `list_files`, `read_file`, and `web_search`. Write operations are gated behind the user confirmation flow in `app.py`, ensuring no file is modified without explicit user approval.
- **Workspace captured once per request** — To avoid a race condition where concurrent workspace changes affect in-flight requests, the effective workspace is resolved once at the start of the SSE generator and passed as a parameter throughout.
- **Session scope extended to file APIs** — In v0.32.7 the same session-aware workspace resolution now applies to preview, raw serve, delete, file list, file-change SSE, health, and workspace routes, eliminating mixed global/session behavior.

## Known Limitations

- **No authentication** — The application has no login or role-based access control. Anyone with network access to port 5000 can use it.
- **Per-session workspace isolation** — The route coverage is now consistent across chat and file APIs, but the `_session_workspaces` dict still has no TTL eviction and the system still lacks real authentication.
- **No CSRF protection** — The application does not include CSRF tokens on form submissions.
- **Single LLM provider dependency** — The system depends entirely on OpenRouter. If the API is unavailable, all features stop working.
- **No formal test framework** — Tests are script-based and require the server to be running. No pytest, unittest, or CI pipeline is configured.
- **No linting or formatting tools** — No pylint, flake8, black, or mypy is configured. Code style relies on manual consistency.
- **PDF character limit** — PDF export is capped at 100,000 characters to prevent WeasyPrint from hanging.
- **Local Agent mode is Windows-only** — The standalone `local_agent.py` server is designed for Windows users and requires manual startup.
- **Basic client-side sanitization** — The `_sanitizeHtml()` function handles common XSS vectors but is not as comprehensive as a dedicated library like DOMPurify.
- **No accessibility audit** — ARIA labels and keyboard navigation have not been formally tested.
- Added session deletion support for the Next.js sidebar, including backend cleanup of the selected session's persisted jobs and file records.
